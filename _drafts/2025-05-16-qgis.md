For a long time, one of my favorite papers in economics has been [this study](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300018110) on the impact of air pollution on life expectancy resulting from China's Huai River policy. In the 1950s, China implemented a policy which directed that areas north of the Huai River received free or highly subsidized coal for indoor heating. Chen at al. take advantage of this arbitrary physical boundary to estimate the effect of increased air pollution on life expectancy, and find that life expectancies are about 5.5 years lower in the north.

Sometimes, policy implementation is divided along political boundaries rather than physical ones. Studying deforestation in the Amazon, [Baragwanath and Bayi](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1917874117) show that areas of land right inside a territory with full property rights experience significantly less deforestation than those right outside the border.

This general line of inquiry works great when a policy is implemented along some pre-existing physical or political boundary. But what should we do when a policy is implemented among some bespoke line, for which no digital record exists?

This is the problem I faced recently when studying the effect of a school noise insulation project around SeaTac Airport. Back in 2002, schools were selected for noise insulation based on whether they fell within the DNL65 noise contour around the airport. DNL, or Day Night Level, is an [imperfect formula](https://seatacnoise.info/dnl65-for-dummies/) that tries to capture the total level of "annoyance" experienced in a given location around the airport. The DNL noise contours are calculated as part of the voluntary [Part 150](https://seatacnoise.info/part-150-for-dummies/) study airports can do to determine the impacts of noise on surrounding communities. The noise contour used to determine eligibility for the school noise insulation program was drawn up in SeaTac Airport's 1991 Part 150 study, and the only record I could track down was a scan of a physical map:

As you can see, the noise contour does not follow any pre-existing boundaries, nor is it any sort of regular shape. The map also lacks a significant amount of detail, so any attempt to trace the noise contour "by hand" would be doomed from the start. So, I need to somehow overlay this map onto another one, then trace out the noise contour to obtain its digital form.

### Enter QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) is a free and open-source GIS software which I have been meaning to learn more about for some time. So let's dive in:

First, start up a new project and import OpenStreetMap as the base layer. We will cross-reference this map with the scanned image to georeference our noise boundary.

Next, let's open up the Georeferencer tool (Layer > Georeferencer). Click the "Open Raster" button and find the image we want to georeference.

From here, we need to carefully add pairs of points which QGIS will use to match up our scanned map with the base layer. For my first point, I chose the intersection of 1st Ave S and S 192nd St, just southwest of the airport.

The scanned map doesn't have a great resolution, so there is going to be some degree of error here. I ended up marking X points to really feel confident about the accuracy of the georeference.

The next decision point is choosing a transformation algorithm. These are described in good detail in the [QGIS Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.html#).
