Among adults covered by health insurance, prevalence of tobacco use is highest among Medicaid members. Reimbursement claims data alone can underestimate tobacco use. We find that supplementing reimbursement claims data with tobacco use information from Medicaid enrollment identified 14,163 (14.0%) additional Medicaid members, including a higher proportion of men and those who did not have a diagnosed chronic condition. Identifying tobacco use during Medicaid enrollment enhances public health data collection and provides opportunities to better diagnose and treat tobacco use.
