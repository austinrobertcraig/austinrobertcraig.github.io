## Motivation

For a long time, one of my favorite papers in economics has been [this study](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1300018110) on the impact of air pollution on life expectancy resulting from China's Huai River policy. In the 1950s, China implemented a policy which directed that areas north of the Huai River received free or highly subsidized coal for indoor heating. Chen at al. take advantage of this arbitrary physical boundary to estimate the effect of increased air pollution on life expectancy, and find that life expectancies are about 5.5 years lower north of the river.

Sometimes, policy implementation is divided along political boundaries rather than physical ones. Studying deforestation in the Amazon, [Baragwanath and Bayi](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1917874117) show that areas of land right inside a territory with full property rights experience significantly less deforestation than those right outside the border.

This general line of inquiry works great when a policy is implemented along some pre-existing physical or political boundary. But what should we do when a policy follows some ad hoc line with no existing digital record?

## The Problem

Back in 2002, schools around Sea-Tac Airport were selected to receive noise insulation funding based on whether they fell within the airport's DNL65 noise contour. DNL, or Day Night Level, is an [imperfect formula](https://seatacnoise.info/dnl65-for-dummies/) that tries to capture the total level of noise-induced annoyance experienced in a given location. The particular noise contour used to determine eligibility for the school noise insulation program was drawn up in Sea-Tac Airport's 1991 [Part 150](https://seatacnoise.info/part-150-for-dummies/) study, and the only record of this boundary I could track down was this scan of a physical map:

</figure>

As you can see, the noise contour does not follow any pre-existing boundaries, nor is it any sort of regular shape. The map also lacks a significant amount of detail, so any attempt to trace the noise contour "by hand" would be doomed from the start. So, I need to somehow overlay this map onto another one, then trace out the noise contour to obtain its digital form.

## Enter QGIS

[QGIS](https://qgis.org/) is a free and open-source GIS software which I have been meaning to learn more about for some time. So let's dive in: the rest of this post will document what I learned as I went through this process.

First, start up a new project and import OpenStreetMap as the base layer. We will cross-reference this map with the scanned image to georeference our noise boundary.

Next, let's open up the Georeferencer tool (Layer > Georeferencer). Click the "Open Raster" button and find the image we want to georeference.

From here, we need to carefully add pairs of ground control points (GCPs) which QGIS will use to match up our scanned map with the base layer. For my first point, I chose the intersection of 1st Ave S and S 192nd St, just southwest of the airport:

<br/>

</figure>

The scanned map doesn't have a great resolution, so there is going to be some degree of error here. I ended up marking 55 points to really feel confident about the accuracy of the georeference.

The next decision point is choosing a transformation algorithm. These are described in good detail in the [QGIS Documentation](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_raster/georeferencer.html#). On the surface, the Thin Plate Splice algorithm seems best suited to handle our slightly inaccurate source map. Unfortunately, the dense shading of the map makes it difficult to identify GCPs in the immediate vicinity of the runways. This results in some major errors in certain areas of the map.

I used a visual examination of the major north-south highways in the region (i5, WA 99, and WA 509) to evaluate the performance of the other transformation algorithms. These highways are comparable in location and direction to the noise contours, so they serve as a useful baseline for the accuracy of the georeference. By this rough metric, I determined that the Polynomial 2 algorithm generated the most accurate transformation.

## Tracing the Noise Contours

I [start by creating a new GeoPackage layer](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/managing_data_source/create_layers.html#creating-a-new-geopackage-layer) on which I will digitize the noise contours. 

The actual process of tracing out the contour is relatively straightforward, if a little tedious. With the new layer selected, click the "Toggle Editing" button on the digitizing toolbar, then "Add Polygon Feature" and "Digitize with Segment." Then just trace out the polygon point-by-point (I found setting the opacity of the scanned map layer to about 65% helped in distinguishing the noise contour from highways).

Here is the finished product, which we can now import into our mapping tool of choice:
