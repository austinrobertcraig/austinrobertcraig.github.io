I designed this map in an effort to better understand the distribution of noise insulation projects in the Highline School District.

The map is interactive - you can click on any point or line for a description of what it represents.

{% include_relative files/highline-map/map.html %}

I describe the process of digitizing the noise contour line in [this post]("https://austinrobertcraig.github.io/posts/2025/05/qgis/").
